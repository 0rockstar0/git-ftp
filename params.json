  "body": "If you use Git and you need to upload your files to an FTP server,\r\nGit-ftp can save you some time and bandwidth by uploading only those files that\r\nchanged since the last upload.\r\n\r\nIt keeps track of the uploaded files by storing the commit id\r\nin a log file on the server. It uses Git to determine which local\r\nfiles have changed.\r\n\r\nYou can easily deploy another branch or go back in the Git history to upload\r\nan older version.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n# Setup\r\ngit config git-ftp.url ftp.example.net\r\ngit config git-ftp.user ftp-user\r\ngit config git-ftp.password secr3t\r\n\r\n# Upload all files\r\ngit ftp init\r\n\r\n# Or if the files are already there\r\ngit ftp catchup\r\n\r\n# Work and deploy\r\necho \"new content\" >> index.txt\r\ngit commit index.txt -m \"Add new content\"\r\ngit ftp push\r\n# 1 file to sync:\r\n# [1 of 1] Buffered for upload 'index.txt'.\r\n# Uploading ...\r\n# Last deployment changed to ded01b27e5c785fb251150805308d3d0f8117387.\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurther Reading\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n* Read the [manual](man/git-ftp.1.md) for more options, features and examples.\r\n* See the [installtion instructions](INSTALL.md) for your system.\r\n* Check [git-ftp issues on GitHub] for open issues.\r\n* Follow this project on twitter [@gitftp].\r\n\r\nLimitations\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n* Windows and OS X: I am very limited in testing on Windows and OS X. Thanks\r\nfor helping me out fixing bugs on these platforms.\r\n* git-ftp as deployment tool: git-ftp was not designed as centralized\r\ndeployment tool. While running git-ftp, you have to take care, no one pushes or\r\ntouches this repo (e.g. no commits, no checkouts, no file modifications)!\r\n\r\nContributions\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nDon't hesitate to improve this tool.\r\nDon't forget to add yourself to the [AUTHORS](AUTHORS) file.\r\nCore functionality is unit tested using shunit2.\r\nYou can find the tests in `tests/`.\r\n\r\nCopyright\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThis application is licensed under [GNU General Public License, Version 3.0]\r\n\r\n[git-ftp issues on GitHub]: http://github.com/git-ftp/git-ftp/issues\r\n[GNU General Public License, Version 3.0]:\r\n http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0-standalone.html\r\n[@gitftp]: https://twitter.com/gitftp\r\n",
