Most of the low-cost\r\nweb hosting companies do not provide SSH or git support, but only FTP.\r\n\r\nThat is why I needed an easy way to deploy my git tracked projects. Instead of\r\ntransfering the whole project, I thought, why not only transfer the files\r\nthat changed since the last time, git can tell me those files.\r\n\r\nEven if you are playing with different branches, git-ftp knows which files\r\nare different. No ordinary FTP client can do that.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\t$ cd my_git_tracked_project\r\n\t$ git ftp push --user <user> --passwd <password> ftp://host.example.com/public_html\r\n\r\nFor interactive password prompt use:\r\n\r\n\t$ git ftp push -u <user> -p - ftp://host.example.com/public_html\r\n\r\nPushing for the first time:\r\n\r\n\t$ git ftp init -u <user> -p - ftp://host.example.com/public_html\r\n\r\nSee [man page] for more options, features and examples!\r\n\r\n[man page]: https://github.com/git-ftp/git-ftp/blob/master/man/git-ftp.1.md\r\n[GNU General Public License, Version 3.0]: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0-standalone.html","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
